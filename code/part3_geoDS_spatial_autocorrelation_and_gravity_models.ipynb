These are structured sets of numbers that formalize geographical relationships between the observations in a dataset.

A fundamental concept in this context is that of *neighbor* and *neighborhood*. By convention, elements in the diagonal ($w_{ii}$) are set to zero. A *neighbor* of a given observation $i$ is another observation with which $i$ has some degree of connection. In terms of $W$, $i$ and $j$ are thus neighbors if $w_{ij} > 0$. Following this logic, the neighborhood of $i$ will be the set of observations in the system with which it has certain connection, or those observations with a weight greater than zero.\n",
